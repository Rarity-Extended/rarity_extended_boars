## Rarity Extended Boars 🐗

Fork from ['the cellar'](https://ftmscan.com/address/0x2A0F1cB17680161cF255348dDFDeE94ea8Ca196A). Boar population increases when someone calls `reproduce()`, and decreases when `kill()` is called. You can simulate kill function calling `simulate_kill()`. Rewards from reproduce are eligible (passed via parm), rewards for kill are random. In both cases, rewards are boosted or decreased, based in a balancer mechanism using `expected_boars` variable.

> You are walking near a large forest. The air fills with the scent of sap, leaves, and decaying leaves. The sun dips below the mountains, revealing the speckled green and brown of the forest floor, the slender trunks of stunted trees, the bird nests in the tops of branches.  
> 
> A burst of voices reach the ears of our adventurer. Two men are arguing about a boar problem. The youngest, an angry farmer, yells at the other, a man in his late middle ages. You can hear the conversation. 
>  
> "I tell you I saw it! A huge black boar... filthy thing! It tore up my prize plants! I only saw the beast, but it's big enough to be a dwarf a harvest price pig! It'll be back soon, you'll see! We need to kill them all !"  
> 
> The older man ignores the farmer's rantings, though his face is hard. "Look, there is no boar big enough to do what you say. What you saw was an elk, or one of those manticores that plague the land sometimes. Boars are necessary to maintain balance of this forest. They must be preserved, protected. And with your hunting, it is about to be broken!"  
> 
>It is getting dark, but our adventurer can still see the farmer's face clearly. He is angry, and quickly becoming hysterical. His jaw is trembling, and his eyes are red and watery. Seeing you, he calls you to ask for help.
